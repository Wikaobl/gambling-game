## Description

This project, developed using **_Object-Oriented Programming_** *(OOP)*, was inspired by the popular concept of a '_slot machine_'. At the beginning you are given 200 zł to play with. You place your bet, and with a simple click on '**_Zakręć!_**' (Spin!), the action begins. Your aim is to match all the squares on the page either with identical colors or completely different ones. When you achieve this, your bet is multiplied by 3, boosting your winnings. However, if your squares don't meet these criteria, you lose the amount you bet. Your remaining balance is displayed beneath the squares, and a summary keeps track of your gameplay statistics, including the number of games played, as well as the games won and lost. <br />
